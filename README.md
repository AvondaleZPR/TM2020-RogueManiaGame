## a plugin gamemode for tm2020 openplanet
heavily relies on tmx api and very poorly written

if you want to contribute, pls msg me on openplanet discord about your PRs otherwise i might miss them

also if you make ANY changes to saves (example: adding a new variable to the save file), pls test the game with this savefile:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MIizEYhcLjQrlo75iaHF53rDCbIB14si/view?usp=sharing
its the oldest one i have and if it works, it means probably any savefile still works
